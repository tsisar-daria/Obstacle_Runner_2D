## DESCRIPTION
Obstacle Runner is a 2D side-scrolling platformer developed in Unity, featuring three challenging levels. The player controls a character that automatically runs through environments filled with various obstacles, such as spikes, pits, and water. The goal is to reach the end of each level without colliding with any obstacles. Each level progressively increases in difficulty, introducing new types of obstacles and requiring faster reflexes and precise timing.
